# Project_Euler_Solutions
Math and programming solutions to the Project Euler problems found from the same site.

Please note, the solutions are organized first according to difficulty.  For example, the folder named "Below_25%" directly reflects Project Euler's rating on their website.  The smaller the percentage, the easier the problem is.

Unlike some, I seek an efficient, mathematical solution to each problem first, before any coding.  With each solution is a pdf file (created with Latex) roughly explaining the mathematics used in my solution.
